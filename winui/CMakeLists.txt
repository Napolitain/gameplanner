# WinUI3 Application requires Visual Studio with Windows App SDK
# This CMakeLists.txt provides a basic structure but Windows-specific
# build configuration is better handled through Visual Studio project files

# Note: Building WinUI3 applications with CMake is complex and not officially supported.
# For production use, it's recommended to use Visual Studio project files (.vcxproj)
# or MSBuild directly.
